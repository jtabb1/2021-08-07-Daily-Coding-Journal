    <p> 
      Today I intend to go to my Amazon job and afterwards or 
      inbetween times I plan to work on either LeetCode or my 
      project. 
    </p>

    <p> 
      Yesterday was a rare occasion where I logged that I planned 
      to do some coding but I actually did not do any coding.  The 
      main things I did yesterday was prepare for work, go to 
      work, got some fast food, talked to and texted some 
      classmates, stopped by the grocery store, came home, 
      checked some things, sat in my chair, and went to sleep.
    </p>

    <p> 
      Next time I need to skip fast food and going to any stores 
      if I am going to expect to do any coding after work.  To be 
      fair to myself, I had expected to be energized by a group coding meeting that had been cancelled after I had gotten 
      fast food.  But now I know how to deal with such 
      eventualities.
